Obsidian plugin to replace arXiv links with formatted metadata (title, authors, etc.). It is based on [obsidian-auto-link-title](https://github.com/zolrath/obsidian-auto-link-title) for the paste/replace operation, on [obsidian-paper-import](https://github.com/zimmerrol/obsidian-paper-import) to fetch arXiv metadata and [paper-note-filler](https://github.com/chauff/paper-note-filler) for the template settings part.
